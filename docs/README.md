# Microsoft Azure Storage Connector

The Microsoft Azure Storage [Connector](https://docs.wso2.com/display/EI611/Working+with+Connectors) allows you to access the [Azure Storage services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/storage/) using Microsoft Azure Storage Java SDK through WSO2 Enterprise Integrator (WSO2 EI). Microsoft Azure Storage is a Microsoft-managed Cloud service that provides highly available and secure storage. Azure Storage consists of three data services: Blob storage, File storage, and Queue storage.

## Getting started
To get started, go to [Configuring MsAzureStorage Operations](config.md). Once you have completed your configurations, you can perform various operations with the connector.
